            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Rather than sharing and distributing one copy of a project and then redistributing that same copy to everyone involved; software like GitHub provides a data repository where each person working on the project can see and review real-time updates. With this solution, the current files or project-related items, are all kept safe on a version control system and each member is given access.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Snapshot Approach</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Any VCS(Version Control System) has a method of storing different points of creation for a project or version. Most VCS's use a system based off of saving one single copy and then tracking each revision made to that original copy, this is a changed-based system. What's interesting about GitHub is that it uses a system based off of taking a unique record of each version as opposed to tracking the changes made to the original. This method provides back more power to the creator of their records of files.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local vs Remote</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Different projects call for different types of Version Control Systems. In a team setting, specifically one with multiple unconnected users, a remote system is the VCS of choice as it allows all the members of the team to maintain copies of their project via a remote Version Control Server. In the case of an individual wishing to maintain safe copies to review of their project, a local repository will provide that for the user.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Three States of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When using GitHub as a VCS there are 3 main states that the files for your project can stay in; committed, modified, and staged. The committed state essentially means that the data has been committed and safely stored. The modified state indicates a difference in files but not yet safely stored. The staged state is an indicator of a newly modofied file being committed as your next version. The entire repository process revolves around these 3 states and is straight-forward for the creator.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Commanding Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In order to ensure that GitHub is receiving your files and updating new versions of them in their system, commands must be used to add, commit, and push your data. Using the add command, git add, allows the current version of the project to be added to the cache as a wished snapshot for the creator to return to and server to store. Then, with the command git commit, the file can be stored safely on the local repository. Finally using the command git push, the user can then send the file to the remote repository.</p>
